Streak is a program designed to keep track of how often you complete certain tasks and assign a "streak" to it. The aim is to design a simple to use program that can show you how often 
you are completing tasks in order to motivate you to either keep going or to start doing a new task again.

A streak is simply how many days in a row you have completed a task. You enter a list of tasks you would like to keep track off and each day you do that task you let Streak know. Streak
will then keep track of your streaks and display information relevant to each task. 

It is being developed using Java to ensure cross platform capability and potentially to be used on Android mobile platforms.
